I used https://github.com/aluveitie/RyzenMacPro files and changed some Data in ACPI for USB porting and also to get sleep working. 
Some SSDTÂ´s are deactivated other new ones are added. Not used or needed kexts are deactivated but still in the directory, if you want to test them.


What is working: 
So far everything....

Only thing is, that if too much USB ports are used, sleep does not work and ends in kernel-panic. Seems to be a USB power topic. No time so far to dive deeper, since it workes with no issues here, since i have only 3-4 USB ports in use at a time...
